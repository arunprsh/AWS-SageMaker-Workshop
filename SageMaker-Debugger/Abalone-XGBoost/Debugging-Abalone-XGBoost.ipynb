    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Amazon SageMaker Debugger is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis.\n",
    "Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning algorithms, tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis.\n",
    "Although XGBoost is not a deep learning algorithm, Amazon SageMaker Debugger is highly customizable and can help provide interpretability by saving insightful metrics, such as performance metrics or feature importances, at different frequencies.\n",
    "Refer to [documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/xgboost.md) for details on how to save the metrics you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After the tensors are saved, perform automatic analysis by running debugging ***[Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-built-in-rules.html)***.\n",
    "On a very broad level, a rule is Python code used to detect certain conditions during training.\n",
    "Some of the conditions that a data scientist training an algorithm may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger comes pre-packaged with certain rules that can be invoked on Amazon SageMaker. Users can also write their own rules using the Amazon SageMaker Debugger APIs. \n",
    "For more information about automatic analysis using a rule, see the [rules documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md)."

    "\n",
    "estimator = Estimator(\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    debugger_hook_config = DebuggerHookConfig(\n",

    "            CollectionConfig(\n",
    "                name=\"metrics\",\n",
    "                parameters={\n",

    "        ]\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the `DebuggerHookConfig` object instructs `Estimator` what data we are interested in.\n",
    "Two parameters are provided in the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s3_output_path`: it points to S3 bucket/path where we intend to store our debugging tensors.\n",
    "  Amount of data saved depends on multiple factors, major ones are: training job / data set / model / frequency of saving tensors.\n",
    "  This bucket should be in your AWS account, and you should have full access control over it.\n",
    "  **Important Note**: this s3 bucket should be originally created in the same region where your training job will be running, otherwise you might run into problems with cross region access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `collection_configs`: it enumerates named collections of tensors we want to save.\n",
    "  Collections are a convinient way to organize relevant tensors under same umbrella to make it easy to navigate them during analysis.\n",
    "  In this particular example, you are instructing Amazon SageMaker Debugger that you are interested in a single collection named `metrics`.\n",
    "  We also instructed Amazon SageMaker Debugger to save metrics every 10 iteration.\n",

    "- `rules`: This new parameter will accept a list of rules you wish to evaluate against the tensors output by this training job.\n",
    "  For rules, Amazon SageMaker Debugger supports two types:\n",
    "  - SageMaker Rules: These are rules specially curated by the data science and engineering teams in Amazon SageMaker which you can opt to evaluate against your training job.\n",
    "  - Custom Rules: You can optionally choose to write your own rule as a Python source file and have it evaluated against your training job.\n",
    "    To provide Amazon SageMaker Debugger to evaluate this rule, you would have to provide the S3 location of the rule source and the evaluator image.\n",
